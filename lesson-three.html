        <p> Welcome to our Lesson 3! Now that we know how to introduce ourselves and our friends, it's time to talk about family!
    	Since we already know a bit about <em>natural gender</em>,  we will try to connect the words which represent family members with the image of one lovely family.<br></p>
    
        <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="family-img" id="family-img">

        <p> They look cute, right? Read the sentences below and try to understand what they mean. Which words do we use for members of our family? You can find correct answers <a href="#answers" class="external-link">at the bottom of the page.</a></p>

        <div class="examples">

            <p>La familia tiene un padre, una madre y dos hijos.</p>
            <p>Los padres tienen una hija y un hijo.</p>
            <p>El niño tiene una hermana.</p>
            <p>La niña tiene un hermano.</p>

        </div>

        <p> Before checking the translation, try to say in Spanish if you have any brothers or sisters and how many.</p>
