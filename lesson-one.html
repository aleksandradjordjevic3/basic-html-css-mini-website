        <p> This is how we say "Hello!" in Spanish! Note that letter 'H' is never pronounced - just pretend it doesn't exist when you see it. Try reading this everyday greeting outloud now. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deUxsQOGps" class="external-link" target="_blank">this video</a> to make sure you read it correctly. There are many new words in there! Good job!</p>

        <p> Now look at the drawing bellow to learn how to say your name and ask for other people's names. 
         Here focus on letter <b>'LL'</b> in the word <em>'llamas'</em>. It is pronounced almost the same as <b>'Y'</b> in <em>'yes'</em>. Depending on the country they grew up in, Spanish speaking people will pronounce this letter slightly different - but don't worry about that now. <br>Watch<a class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vSKZl7Nd8" target="_blank">this video</a> to hear correct pronunciation and practice. </p>
